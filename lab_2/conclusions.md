## Question
For students enrolled in the Basic Sciences program, does students'
academic self perception (DREEM: Academic Self Perception) predict their
Medical School Quality of Life (MS.QoL). If so, what if the nature of that relationship?


After analyzing resilience data of students enrolled in the Basic Sciences program in a South American country,
it was discovered that Academic Self Perception (ASP) significantly predicts Medical School Quality of Life (MSQL).
The overall regression model, intercept of 4.176 and slope of 0.135, was significant with an
F-statistic F(1, 254) = 46.92 and it showed a proportion of variance of 15.59%.
After outlier analysis was performed, a single outlier with the highest Cook’s distance (0.0413) was removed from the
dataset. This resulted in an increase in %variance accounted for to 16.55% as well as a higher F statistic F(1, 253) = 50.16.
The new intercept and slope were found to be 4.072 (t(253)=11.057) and 0.140 (t(253)=7.082), respectively.

Claims that the study was flawed were refuted by performing a linear hypothesis test between our
slope 0.140 and a separate study’s slop 0.175. It was found that, in fact, the slopes are not significantly
different F(1, 253) = 3.174, p = 0.08 > 0.05.
