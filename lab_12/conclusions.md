An analysis of data representing 1369 adults diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, examining various social, demographic, and medical factors as well as a psychological measure of distress, was performed. The research question was: What variables (Age, Marriage level, Number of other illnesses, or Daily Sleep duration) significantly predict Psychological Distress for adult patients with Diabetes Mellitus?

Initial model investigation showed 4 outliers. The new, outlier free, model showed a significant overall effect, LRx2(4) = 40.8, p <0.05, with a Pseudo R2 of 4.32%. The effect of Number of other illnesses on the outcome of Distress was significant with LRx2(4) = 18.33, p <0.05 and the best predictor of the outcome. There was a significant difference across 3 levels of Number of Other Illnesses, with 3 or more illnesses predicting 2.86% probability of Distress.
