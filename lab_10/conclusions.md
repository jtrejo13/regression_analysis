An analysis of data representing a sample of 342 patients examined for the presence of Prostate penetration by tumor cell was performed. The research question was: Among the observed patients, investigating the variables of Age, PSA score, tumor Volume, and Gleason Score, what is the best predictor of tumor cell penetration into the Prostate?

After checking the spread of the data was ok, an initial regression model was run to discover any potential violations in the data with our assumptions (low covariance, no outliers). Low covariance was confirmed and 3 outliers were found and deleted as they reported a Cookâ€™s distance of greater than 2 * (4/n-k-1). The first model gave an indication that there exists a significant relationship between PSA score, tumor Volume, and Gleason score, on the presence of a prostate tumor.

Once it was confirmed that the basic data assumptions were met, and outliers were removed, the model was re-run to observe an overall model's chi-square value (LR chi2(4) = 101.86, p < 0.05) and R^2 = 35.0%. Analysis showed two out of the three predictors, PSA and Gleason scores, to be significant, with PSA z(339) = 3.171, p < 0.05 and Gleason z(339) = 5.927, p < 0.05. The odds ratios of PSA and Gleason were 1.03 and 2.79, respectively. It was found that a 27.77 value of PSA score and a 6.77 Gleason Score mark the 50% probability of having a prostate tumor.
