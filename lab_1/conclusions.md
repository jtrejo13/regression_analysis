## Question

#### Does change in Total Gray Matter Volume (delta_TotalGrayVol) significantly predict change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (delta_edss)? If so, what is the nature of the relationship?

The change in Total Gray Matter Volume (ΔTGMV) does predict the change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (ΔEDSS) in patients with Multiple Sclerosis. After analyzing the data, it was observed there exists a **positive**, **linear** relationship between ΔTGMV and ΔEDSS. The relationship between the two metrics is **moderate**, as the **Pearson correlation coefficient** was found to be **0.31**. In addition, the correlation was found to be **significant** given that **t(68) = 2.66, p = 0.0097**. The linear regression model showed that ΔTGMV accounted for **9.43%** of the variance in ΔEDSS, with the intercept and slope of the model calculated to be **-0.333**, and **0.101** respectively. Finally, outlier identification was part of the data analysis. The Cook’s distance for all data points was calculated and **3 outliers** with distances of 0.1247, 0.0636, and 0.0736, were found and removed.
