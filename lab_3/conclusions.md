# Conclusions

## Question
Examine the effect of Age, D125 metabolite, weight, BMI, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) on vitamin D blood serum levels (D25). After controlling for all the variables of interest, which is the strongest predictor of Vitamin D serum levels - and what is the nature of that relationship?


## Conclusions

Biometric data of 449 East Asian children were analyzed to discover whether or not vitamin D (D25) blood serum levels can be predicted by a child’s age, weight, BMI, D125 metabolites, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. An initial multivariate regression model showed that weight was highly multicollinear with respect to the other independent variables, with a Variance Inflation Factor of 12.28 — this makes sense given that a child’s weight is, generally, closely related to her age and BMI. Weight was therefore removed from the model. Cook’s distance outlier analysis was carried out as part of the investigation. This analysis revealed 2 outliers with Cook’s distance greater than 0.10. Finally, a check for homoscedasticity was also performed before finalizing the model.



The final model had an F-statistic of F(4,442) = 15.1, p < 0.05 adjusted R2 value of 11.2%. In addition, it was found that the best predictor of vitamin D (D25) blood serum levels is PTH with given that it had the highest (magnitude) Standardized beta of all the independent variables (- 0.285) and uniquely accounted for 7.42% of the variance in the output variable.
