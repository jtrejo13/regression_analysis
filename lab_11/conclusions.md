An analysis of data representing 782 young men from the NLSY survey for employment, and examining the outcome of employment in relation to other demographic factors. was performed, was performed. The research question was: After controlling for age, mother's high school graduation, father's high school graduation, and family income, what is the impact of intelligence (as measured by the Armed Services aptitude test) on employment outcome (Not employed, employed, or in school)?

Multinomial Logistic Regression analysis was used to answer the above research question. The overall model for training data was significant overall (LR chi2(3) = 90.04, p < 0.05). It was found that the effect of aptitude on the model predicting employment over no employment was significant (OR = 1.44, z(196) = 3.1, p < 0.05), while the effect of aptitude on the model predicting in school status over no employment was not (OR = 1.23, z(196) = 1.8, p > 0.05). To put things in perspective, the average predicted probability of being employed at an aptitude score of +1 was 40.45%, while the probability of not being employed was 19.67% for the same score.

Overall the model did a poor job of predicting employment outcome (Nagelkerke R2 : 12.30%). And when the model was used on an additional data set of employment, the overall classification was also poor (Classification accuracy: 47.96 %)
