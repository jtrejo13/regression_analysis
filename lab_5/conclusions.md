An analysis of dental anxiety data was performed to determine what predictors
significantly impact the outcome of Dental Fear (DFS) among Turkish adults,
controlling for age, sex, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and education level
(primary, secondary, high school and university).

After “dummy” coding the gender and education variables, an initial regression
model was run (with Male and Primary education as reference) to discover any
potential violations in the data with our assumptions (linearity,
homoscedasticity, no outliers, no significant colinearity). The model reported
an F-statistic of F(6,200) = 85.96, p < 0.05, and an R^2 of 72.1%. From this
model, it was discovered that while colinearity was not an issue among
independent variables (all variables reported a VIF value < 5), 3 outliers
were found and deleted as they reported a Cooks distance of two times the
cutoff (2 * 4 / (n - k - 1)).

Once it was confirmed our assumptions were met, and outliers were removed, the
model was re-run (again with Male and Primary education as reference) to observe
an increase in the F-statistic (F(6,197) = 91.81, p < 0.05) and R^2 = 73.7%.
All the predictor variables in the model (age, sex, BDI, and education level)
were significant predictors of DFS. BDI showed a significant positive impact on
quality of life (t(197) = 6.812, p < 0.05), and could account for 6.20 % of
unique variance in the model. Education also showed a significant impact
(F(3, 197) = 21.93, p < 0.05), and accounted for 8.79 % of the variance in
DFS. Age and Sex, although significant, only accounted for 0.54 % and 2.22%
of the variance in DFS, respectively. The best predictor of DFS was, therefore,
Education.

Finally, a Bonferroni-Holm adjusted post-hoc investigation of Education levels
showed that there was a significant difference in DFS between all four groups.
